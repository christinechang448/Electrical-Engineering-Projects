# Electrical Engineering Projects

This repository showcases a collection of electrical engineering projects I have designed and built. Each project highlights a mix of practical circuit design, embedded systems programming, and applied problem-solving. The work documented here reflects my interests in power systems, hardware development, and data-driven engineering.

## Repository Structure
Each project folder contains:
- Schematics and wiring diagrams
- Source code (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or Python)
- Bill of Materials (BOM)
- Build notes and design explanations
- Project documentation (reports, visuals, and results)

## Featured Projects
-  

## Tools & Technologies
- **Circuit Design & Simulation** – KiCad, Altium, MATLAB/Simulink  
- **Embedded Systems** – Arduino, Raspberry Pi, ESP32  
- **Programming** – C/C++, Python  
- **Hardware Prototyping** – PCB design, soldering, 3D printing  

## Purpose
This repository serves as both a technical portfolio and a record of my engineering development. Projects are documented to demonstrate:
- Strong foundations in circuit design and embedded hardware  
- Experience bridging theory with practical implementation  
- Interest in sustainable systems, power management, and hardware for data infrastructure
